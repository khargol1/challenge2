# README
## Intro
Hello and welcome to my profile page. This will be a place for me to showcase my skills and projects. Currently this is still a work in progress.

## HTML

### Format
The site is designed around 5 sections stacked vertically and running the width of the screen. The header and nave comprise the first section with the hero as the second. The third through fifth sections are each sub divided into two areas. The fist area is for section titles which appear on the left and content appears in the second area on the right. The final contact me section serves as the footer.

### Notes
* There is only 1 img tag in the entire document, all other images are backgrounds.
* The current picture is a placeholder and alt text says as much. When the barber opens back up i'll fix that one.


## CSS
The css sheet attempts to follow the order of the HTML file at all times. Media queries were used to adjust for screen sizes smaller than a desktop. 


### Media Queries
Specifically regarding all media queries, the intent is to keep the site looking the same. This decision was made due to the lack of page effects that might render poorly phone and the lack of elements that may not work properly. Also the site will look correct at the stated resolutions but some elements may be hard to read at sizes which are in-between break points.
